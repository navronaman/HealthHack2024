Please read the data from the patient's urine test report and create a professional, structured doctor's report with the following format:

---

**Title**: Urine Report

**Patient Name**: [Patient’s Name]  
**Date of Testing**: [Date of Entry]  
**Type of Test**: [Type of Test, e.g., Urinalysis, Microscopic Examination]

**Findings**:
For each critical finding, provide a detailed analysis in paragraph form without line breaks between sentences. Emphasize critical values by bolding them, and explain their medical significance. For example, write findings like this:
"The patient's **specific gravity** of **1.017** indicates mildly concentrated urine. The presence of **nitrites** suggests a bacterial infection, likely a urinary tract infection (UTI). Elevated **white blood cells (WBC)** further support this diagnosis."

**Required Critical Findings to Address**:
1. Specific Gravity
2. pH
3. Protein
4. Glucose
5. Ketones
6. Leukocyte Esterase
7. Nitrites
8. Red Blood Cells (RBC)
9. White Blood Cells (WBC)
10. Bacteria
11. Epithelial Cells

**Recommendations**:
Provide specific recommendations based on the findings. If a UTI is suggested, recommend further testing (like a urine culture) and possible initial treatment options. Each recommendation should be in a separate paragraph for clarity.

End the report with:
"Sign of Doctor: Dr. [Doctor’s Name]"

---

This format should result in a report with well-organized sections and clear, complete paragraphs for each finding.
