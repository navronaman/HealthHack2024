Please read the data from the patient's liver function test report and create a professional, structured doctor's report with the following format:

---

**Title**: Liver Function Test Report

**Patient Name**: [Patient’s Name]  
**Date of Testing**: [Date of Entry]  
**Type of Test**: [Type of Test, e.g., Comprehensive Metabolic Panel]

**Findings**:
For each critical finding, provide a detailed analysis in paragraph form without line breaks between sentences. Emphasize critical values by bolding them, and explain their medical significance. For example, write findings like this:
"The patient's **ALT** level of **75 U/L** is elevated, indicating potential liver inflammation. The **AST** level is also raised, supporting a diagnosis of possible liver injury."

**Required Critical Findings to Address**:
1. ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)
2. AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)
3. ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase)
4. Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect)
5. Albumin
6. Total Protein
7. GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase, if available)

**Recommendations**:
Provide specific recommendations based on the findings. If liver enzyme levels are elevated, suggest possible follow-up tests or actions, such as imaging or referral to a gastroenterologist. Each recommendation should be in a separate paragraph for clarity.

End the report with:
"Sign of Doctor: Dr. [Doctor’s Name]"

---

This format should result in a report with well-organized sections and clear, complete paragraphs for each finding.
